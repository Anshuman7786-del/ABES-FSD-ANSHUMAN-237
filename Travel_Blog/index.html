    <p>Delhi, the capital city of India, is a place where history, culture, and modern life come together beautifully. As you wander through Delhi, you’ll find yourself moving between centuries — from ancient Mughal architecture like the Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, and the towering Qutub Minar, to the lively streets of Chandni Chowk packed with street food, spice markets, and colorful shops.<br>

If you’re looking for the best places to visit in Delhi, don’t miss the elegance of India Gate, the spiritual calm of the Lotus Temple and Akshardham, or the bustling vibe of Connaught Place. And of course, no Delhi travel experience is complete without tasting its legendary street food — hot parathas, tangy chaats, and sweet jalebis.<br>

Delhi is not just a city, it’s an unforgettable journey. Whether you’re exploring historical monuments, enjoying local cuisine, or simply soaking in the energy of this vibrant metropolis, Delhi will leave you with stories worth sharing.
